PROJECTS ENABLING CHANGES
Project can be a vehicle for change in an organization. It takes a company from a 
current state to desire state.

PHASES VS DELIVERABLES
A phase is a collection of logically related project activities that culminates in the
completion of one or more deliverables. #phases depends on the industry type, size
and complexity of the project.
A deliverable is any unique and verifiable product, service or result. It could be tangible
or intangible. Must e accepted by the customer or sponsor for the phase.

PROJECT LIFE CYCLE
A representation of phases that a project typically goes through from start to finish.
Can be either predictive or adaptive. A project life cycle is made by the project manager.

PROECT GOVERNANCE
Project governance is a framework within which project decisions are made. Three pillars for
project givernance are structure, people and information.

STAKEHOLDERS
Individuals, group or organization that may affect, e affected = or percieve to be 
affected by the project. Key stakeholders usually are project manager, customer, team
project sponsor and functional manager.

Milestone -> A milestone is a significant event or achievement in a project that marks a
key point or completion of a major deliverable.
Task duration -> Refers to the amount of time it takes to complete a specific task or activity withing a project.

ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURES
-> Functional organizations : Structure that groups staff members according to their area of expertise. Functional 
structures require the project team members to report directly to the functional manager.
-> Matrix organizations : There exists three matrix structures, Weak, balanced and strong.
The different structures are reflective of the project manager's authority in relation to
the functional manager's authority.
-> Project oriented organizations : PM has the greatest authority. The project team is assigned to the project full time
when the project is over, the team members moves on to other assignments within the organization.
->Hybrid also exists.

PROJECT BOSSES
-> Sponsor : Can be internal or external, funding the project, makes the decisions
-> Program manager : Senior to project manager, resolves conflicts in the project.

AREAS OF PROJECT

->Issues refer to the problems or challenges that arise during the course of project. Can hinder progress or impact
project objectives.
-> Assumptions are statements or beliefs that are considered to be true or valid for the purpose of planning.
-> Constraints are limitations or restrictions that affect project planning and execution.

PROJECT CONSTRAINTS
-> There are six - SSCRQR
1. Scope
2. Schedule
3. Cost
4. Risk
5. Quality
6. Resources

PROJECT MANAGEMENT APPROACHES
-> There are two approaches : Predictive and Adaptive.

Predictive Approach : 

This follows a linear and sequential process. Involves detailed planning
and documentation upfront, with a focus on predicting and defining the project scope, objectives, timeline and deliverables. Involves extensive upfront planning, sequential execution, emphasis on control or documentation. Limited flexibility, limited changes with a well defined change control process.

Adaptive Approach :

Focuses on flexibility, collab and iterative development. Embraces change throughout the project and emphasizes continous feedback and improvement. Iterative and incremental development, involves customer collaboration, emphasizes adaptability, involves self-organizing teams. This approach is used commonly in agile methodologies like Scrum or Kanban.

EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE
EQ refers to the ability to recognize, understand and manage emotions, both in oneself and in others.

-> Value can be realized throughout the project
-> Value, and the benefits that contribute to value, can be defined in quantitative and qualitative terms!
-> Project teams evaluate progress and adapt to maximize the expected value.
-> Value is subjective.
-> To support value realization from projects, the project teams should shift focus from deliverables to the intended outcomes. Doing so allows the teams to deliver on the vision or purpose of the project, rather than simply creating a specific deliverable.

SYSTEMS THINKING
-> A system is a set of interacting and interdependent components that function as a unified whole.
-> A project is a system of interdependent and interacting domains of activity.
-> systems thinking entails taking a holistic view of how project parts interact with each other and with external systems.

TAILORING BASED ON CONTEXT
-> Each project is unique.
-> Design the project development methods based on the needs of the project and it's objectives, stakeholders, governance, and the environment.
-> Project success is based on adapting to the unique context of the project.

-> Teams measure quality using metrics and acceptance criterias'.

COMPLEXITY
-> Complexity is the outcome of human behavior, system interactions, uncertainity and ambiguity.
-> Complexity can arise at any point during the project.
-> Constantly evaluate and navigate project complexity so when it approaches the team can succesfully navigate the entire project.
-> Project teams have to stay vigilant in identifying elements of complexity and use a variety of methods to reduce the amount of impact of complexity.
-> Project teams often cannot forecast complexity emerging because it is result of many conditions and events.

RISK
-> A risk is an uncertain event or condition that,if it occurs, can have a poitive or negative effect on one or more objectives.
-> Risks can be positive or negative.
-> Constantly evaluate exposure to risk, both opportunities and threats, to maximize positive impacts and minimize negative impacts to the projects and it's outcomes.
-> Risks are addressed throughout the project.
-> Risk response should be:

	- Cost effective
	- Realistic within the project context
	- agreed to by relevant stakeholder
-> Project team members engage with relevant stakeholders to understand their risk appetite and risk thresholds.
-> an organization's risk attitude, appetite, and threshold influence how risk is addressed.

ADAPTABILITY AND RESILIENCE
-> Adaptability is the ability to respond to changing conditions.
-> resiliency is the ability to absorb impacts and to recover quickly from a setback or failure.
-> Build adaptability and resiliency into the organization and project team's approaches.

CHANGE
-> Prepare those impacted for the acceptance to go from current state to the intended future state created by the project output.
-> A structured approach will help individuals, groups, and the organization transition from current state to future state which is desired.
-> Attempting too much change in short time can lead to change fatigue and/or resistance.
